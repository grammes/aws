# What is this?

This repo contains a cloudformation stack definition that defines a DNS redirect for Route53 from [gramm.es](http://gramm.es) to [grammes.github.io](http://grammes.github.io).

It also contains the definition of a GitHub action that deploys that stack to AWS.

Using this definition, the website in [grammes/grammes.github.io](https://github.com/grammes/grammes.github.io) becomes available at [gramm.es](http://gramm.es).
